# CTF_challenge_February 2024

This challenge revolves around the vulnerabilities associated with randomness and the potential risks of re-entrancy attacks. Relying on timestamps for security is problematic, as attackers can exploit this predictability to anticipate blocks. To demonstrate this issue, participants are encouraged to run the CoinFlip function and make a simultaneous guess, allowing them to discern the outcome. 

## Instructions

* Fork the repo with the code base and issues template file.
* Update the visibilty of the forked repo to private
* Create a new file with your name (as in auditone app) in the forked repo
* Solve the challenge and write your attack code in the new file
* Add "AuditOne-Gracious" as collaborator to the private repo of yours.
